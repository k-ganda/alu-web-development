Implementing a webpage from scratch from a designer file.
The webpage should look like this:
    ![image](https://github.com/k-ganda/alu-web-development/assets/116561806/0d35692d-8b3e-4260-b376-76d27da4f739)

For the first project, focus is on the HTML structure.

Designer file will be available on Figma.

Steps to Figma : 
    1. Create an account to access the final result.
    2. Click on the down arrow close to view only.
    3. Choose "Duplicate to your drafts". This will allow you to have access to all the design details.

NOTE:   1.If your computer doesnâ€™t have missing fonts, you  can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
        2. Some values are in float - feel free to round them.
